## Reporting a Vulnerability


To report a security vulnerability, please use the [Vulnerability Reporting Program link here](https://PUTBUGCROWDPORTALHERE).  OWASP will coordinate the fix and
disclosure.

If you have found a security vulnerability, in order to keep it confidential,
please do not report an issue on GitHub.

We do not award bounties for security vulnerabilities.
