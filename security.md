## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please use the [Vulnerability Reporting Program link here](https://PUTBUGCROWDPORTALHERE).  OWASP will coordinate the fix and
disclosure.

If you have found a security vulnerability, in order to keep it confidential,
please do not report an issue on GitHub.

We do not award bounties for security vulnerabilities.

## OpenSSF's Policy (template)
Security

Per the Linux Foundation Vulnerability Disclosure Policy, if you find a vulnerability in a project maintained by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), please report that directly to the project maintaining that code, preferably using GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting.

If you've been unable to find a way to report it, or have received no response after repeated attempts, please contact the OpenSSF security contact email, security@openssf.org.

Thank you.
